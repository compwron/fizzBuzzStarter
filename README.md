FizzBuzz problem: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

This repo is the starting state for the simple FizzBuzz kata, with the same failing test in both the java and ruby versions.
